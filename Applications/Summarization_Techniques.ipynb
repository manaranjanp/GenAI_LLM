       " Document(page_content='Karpathy took to the social network X (formerly Twitter) to re-share a widely circulated blog post thought to be authored by a poster on Hacker News that speculates “the capacity of large scale H100 clusters at small and large cloud providers is running out,” and that H100 demand will continue its trend till the end of 2024, at a minimum.\\n\\nThe author guesses that OpenAI might want 50,000 H100s, while Inflection wants 22,000, Meta “maybe 25k,” while “big clouds might want 30k each (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, plus Oracle). Lambda and CoreWeave and the other private clouds might want 100k total. Anthropic, Helsing, Mistral and Character might want 10k each, he wrote.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The author said that these estimates are “total ballparks and guessing, and some of that is double-counting both the cloud and the end customer who will rent from the cloud. But that gets to about 432k H100s. At approx $35K a piece, that’s about $15B worth of GPUs. That also excludes Chinese companies like ByteDance (TikTok), Baidu and Tencent who will want a lot of H800s. There are also financial companies each doing deployments starting with hundreds of A100s or H100s and going to thousands of A/H100s: names like Jane Street, JP Morgan, Two Sigma, Citadel.”\\n\\nDemand for GPUs is like ‘Game of Thrones,’ says one VC\\nThe closest analogy to the battle to get access to AI chips is the television hit ‘Game of Thrones,’ David Katz, partner at Radical Ventures, told VentureBeat recently. “There’s this insatiable appetite for compute that’s required in order to run these models and large models,” he said.'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Last year, Radical invested in CentML, which optimizes machine learning (ML) models to work faster and lower compute costs. CentML’s offering, he said, creates “a little bit more efficiency” in the market. In addition, it demonstrates that complex, billion-plus-parameter models can also run on legacy hardware.\\n\\n“So you don’t need the same volume of GPUs, or you don’t need the A100s necessarily,” he said. “From that perspective, it is essentially increasing the capacity or the supply of chips in the market.”\\n\\nHowever, those efforts may be more effective for those working on AI inference, rather than training LLMs from scratch, according to Sid Sheth, CEO of d-Matrix, which is building a platform to save money on inference by doing more processing in the computer’s memory, rather than on a GPU.')]"

    "Stuffing is the simplest method, whereby you simply stuff all the related data into the prompt as context to pass to the language model. This is implemented in LangChain as the StuffDocumentsChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Only makes a single call to the LLM. When generating text, the LLM has access to all the data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:** Most LLMs have a context length, and for large documents (or many documents) this will not work as it will result in a prompt larger than the context length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main downside of this method is that **it only works one smaller pieces of data.**  Once you are working with many pieces of data, this approach is no longer feasible. The next two approaches are designed to help deal with that.\n",
